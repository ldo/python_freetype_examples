These scripts show examples of the use of my python_freetype
([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/python_freetype),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/python_freetype)) module. You will need to have that
installed before you can run these. The examples are:

* code_coverage -- show the character code coverage of a font
* font_chart -- generate a chart of all characters in a font
* mm_demo -- a demonstration of Multiple Masters fonts
* render_text -- simple renderer of a line of text

All except the first one need Qahirah ([GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ldo/qahirah),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/ldo17/qahirah)) to be installed; this is my pure-Python binding
for the Cairo graphics library.

The file code_blocks.py contains some common Unicode definitions needed by a couple of the
scripts.

See the header comments in each script for more details.

You can see examples of graphical output on my [DeviantArt
account](https://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/56395641/Python-FreeType-Examples).
