These scripts show examples of the use of my
[python_freetype](https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype) module. You
will need to have that installed before you can run these. The
examples are:

* code_coverage -- show the character code coverage of a font
* font_chart -- generate a chart of all characters in a font
* mm_demo -- a demonstration of Multiple Masters fonts
* render_text -- simple renderer of a line of text

All except the first one need
[“Qahirah”](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah) to be installed; this is
my pure-Python binding for the Cairo graphics library.

The file code_blocks.py contains some common Unicode definitions
needed by a couple of the scripts.

See the header comments in each script for more details.

You can see examples of graphical output on my [DeviantArt
account](http://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/56395641/Python-FreeType-Examples).
